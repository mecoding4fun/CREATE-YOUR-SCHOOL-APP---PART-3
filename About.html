        <h1>VIDYAYA AMRUTHAM ASHNUTHE</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 0px;">Smt. BhageerathiBai and Shri Narayana Rao Maanaysâ€™ service in the cause of the old age people, orphans, sick, under privileged and backward sections of society, seen in most of the places in Bangalore,  recorded from as early as Nineteen hundred and twenties is highly appreciable. Be it Malleshwaram SevaSadan, the B H S Education Society, The Ashaktha Poshaka Sabha, the Little Sisters of the Poor or the Kidwai Memorial Cancer Hospital another similar organizations in Bangalore; we can find evidence of their goodwill.These acts of theirs were never to be revealed as desired by them since they were of the opinion "Do a good deed and forget it. But remember only the wrong that has taken place and try to overcome it."</h2>
